In this project I explored FairFace dataset with Exploratory Data Analysis, Images Observance and Currently trying to get state-of-the-art result with MobileNetV3 Large model. The last step of the previous sentence includes fine-tuning, modeling, image-augmentation and processing. 
Next steps to apply:
1) img-aug library;
2) albumentation;
3) pytorch-ligtning

I tracked model training and next performance with Tensorboard logging neccessary metrics and losses to the directory, that wasn't pushed here because of its big size.

**To launch a project run ```pip install -e .``` in the root of the project.**
